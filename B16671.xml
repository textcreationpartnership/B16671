            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the Price of Bread is the most National Concern, and the feeding of Hungry Mouths ought to be the greatest Christian Care, there cannot be a more tender Consideration for the Magistracy of the Kingdom, than in present Dearth, and Scarcity of Corn, which we presume, occasions the high Rates now set upon it, to ease and assist the Poor as much as possible, under their Hardships on that Account. As the Prices of Corn are so obvious to every Capacity, the Price of Bread should in all reason only rise suitably; nor should the high Markets of Corn encourage the <hi>Baker</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Umbrage, to Extravagant Rates of his Retail, to the enriching of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by an Universal Oppression upon the People. Now, that this Charge and Accusation upon them, seems grounded upon a great deal of Truth, we think fit to remonstrate that general Grievance, by a plain State of the Case. 'Tis noto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riously known, that the best Wheat now brought to <hi>London,</hi> is to be purchased at about Seven Shillings Nine Pence <hi>per</hi> Bushel. This Corn, though the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Corn is not so large as at some other parts of the Kingdom; nevertheless, still holds out that Measure, that all the Charges of the Grinding it, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it home to any Wharf in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminster,</hi> are satisfied by the Overplus Weight; insomuch, that the Corn ground, stands the <hi>Baker</hi> still in no more than Seven Shillings Nine Pence <hi>per</hi> Bushel, <hi>viz.</hi> at 56 Pound Weight.</p>
            <p>After this, supposing this Corn designed for common Houshold Bread, the small Extract of Bran, and the whole Charge of the Baking does not raise it the utmost above Fifteen Pence more <hi>per</hi> Bushel; so that a Bushel of Corn, when Bak'd, stands the <hi>Baker</hi> in no more than Nine Shillings, which is Two Shillings Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Peck: Now, by the present Allowance of Eight Groats <hi>per</hi> Peck, the <hi>Bakers</hi> Profit is Twenty Pence a Bushel: Now, as the <hi>Baker</hi> bakes thrice a Day, at Three in the Morning Houshold Bread, at Six in the Morning small Bread, and in the Afternoon Houshold Bread again, 'tis notoriously known, that a large Oven will bake a whole Quarter of Wheat at one Batch; yet modestly computing that the <hi>Baker</hi> at his Three Batches bakes but Two Quarters, and in each Bushel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
